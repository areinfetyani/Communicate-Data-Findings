# Project 3: Communicating Data Insights — Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree

This repository contains the third project for Udacity’s Data Analyst Nanodegree. The objective is to perform both exploratory and explanatory data analysis on a real-world dataset, uncovering trends and clearly communicating key insights through visualizations and narrative.

## 📌 Project Summary

The dataset used in this project is from **Ford GoBike**, a bike-sharing system in the San Francisco Bay Area. It includes detailed records of trips made during **February 2019**.

The project consists of two main components:

- **Part I - Exploratory Analysis:**  
  This section involves a thorough exploration using summary statistics and visual tools to identify meaningful patterns within the data.

- **Part II - Explanatory Analysis:**  
  This part focuses on creating clear, audience-friendly visuals and narratives to highlight the most important findings.
